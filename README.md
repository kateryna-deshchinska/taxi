#### It's a simple web app that shows logic managing for taxi service. In this app you can :
- Create drivers, cars, manufacturers;
- Delete drivers, cars, manufacturers;
- Add new driver to car;
- Get information about all cars belonging to the driver;
- Get information about all cars in our taxi service;
- Get information about all drivers;
- Get information about all manufacturers;

#### _The project is based on N-architecture and SOLID principles. There are 3 layers: CONTROLLERS, SERVICE, and DAO. Also, this app allows access only to authorized drivers and provides the ability to register new ones._
